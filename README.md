# BlackFriday-sales-Prediction

The purpose of the present study involves creating a prediction model for the user to estimate the
customer purchase during one of the busiest days, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, and one of the
largest shopping days in the USA. To aid retailers, we are making use of Regression models such as
Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree to predict customer
purchase. R-Square and RMSE values have been used to evaluate the model performance. We have also
built a “Product Recommender Model” which recommends the products to users based on the purchase
habits of similar users.
